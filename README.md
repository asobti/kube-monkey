## kube-monkey
kube-monkey is an implementation of [Netflix's Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) for [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) 
clusters. It randomly deletes Kubernetes pods in the cluster encouraging and validating the development of failure-resilient
services.

kube-monkey has two modes or running:

1. Safe mode on
kube-monkey runs at a pre-configured hour (`run_hour`, defaults to 8am) on weekdays, and builds a schedule of deployments that will face a random
Pod death sometime during the same day. The time-range during the day when the random pod Death might occur is configurable and
defaults to 10am to 4pm.

2. Safe mode off
kube-monkey runs exactly as in the **Safe mode on** but in this mode the selection of deployments is performed selecting all deployments that are not labeled
properly for ignoring. Also it takes count of the blacklisted namespaces (no deployment will be selected from the blacklist)


kube-monkey can be configured with a list of namespaces to blacklist - any deployments within a blacklisted namespace will not 
be touched.

## Opting-In to Chaos

kube-monkey works on an opt-in model and will only schedule terminations for Deployments that have explicitly agreed 
to have their pods terminated by kube-monkey.

Opt-in is done by setting the following labels on a Kubernetes Deployment:

**`kube-monkey/enabled`**: Set to **`"enabled"`** to opt-in to kube-monkey  
**`kube-monkey/disabled`**: Set to **`"true"`** for excluding - available only for safe_mode=false
**`kube-monkey/mtbf`**: Mean time between failure (in days). For example, if set to **`"3"`**, the Deployment can expect to have a Pod
killed approximately every third weekday.  
**`kube-monkey/identifier`**: A unique identifier for the deployment (eg. the deployment's name). This is used to identify the pods 
that belong to a Deployment as Pods inherit labels from their Deployment.  
**`kube-monkey/kill-all`**: Set this label's value to `"kill-all"` if you want kube-monkey to kill ALL of your pods. Default behavior in the absence of this label is to kill only ONE pod. **Use this label carefully.**


#### Example of opted-in Deployment

```yaml
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: monkey-victim
  namespace: app-namespace
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kube-monkey/enabled: enabled
        kube-monkey/identifier: monkey-victim
        kube-monkey/mtbf: '2'
[... omitted ...]
```
## Opting-Out of Chaos

when kube-monkey is configured with **Safe mode off**, this will select all deployments that are not labeled properly. This mode was created for a Development need. You will label the deployments that should not be elected in the scheduling phase.

Opt-out is done by setting the following labels on a Kubernetes Deployment:

**`kube-monkey/disabled`**: Set to **`"true"`** for excluding - available only for safe_mode=false
**`kube-monkey/identifier`**: This label name can be configured. Rename it properly to match your deployments labels (assuming that you have the same label name with unique value for each Deployment). A unique identifier for the deployment (eg. the deployment's name). This is used to identify the pods 
that belong to a Deployment as Pods inherit labels from their Deployment.  
**`kube-monkey/kill-all`**: Set this label's value to `"kill-all"` if you want kube-monkey to kill ALL of your pods. Default behavior in the absence of this label is to kill only ONE pod. **Use this label carefully.**


#### Example of opted-in Deployment

```yaml
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: monkey-victim
  namespace: app-namespace
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        kube-monkey/identifier: monkey-victim
[... omitted ...]
```



## How kube-monkey works

#### Scheduling time
Scheduling happens once a day on Weekdays - this is when a schedule for terminations for the current day is generated.   
During scheduling, kube-monkey will:  
1. Generate a list of eligible deployments (deployments that have opted-in and are not blacklisted)  
2. For each eligible deployment, flip a biased coin (bias determined by `kube-monkey/mtbf`) to determine if a pod for that deployment should be killed today  
3. For each victim, calculate a random time when a pod will be killed

#### Termination time
This is the randomly generated time during the day when a victim Deployment will have a pod killed.   
At termination time, kube-monkey will:  
1. Check if the deployment is still eligible (has not opted-out or been blacklisted since scheduling)  
2. Get a list of running pods for the deployment  
3. Select one random pod and delete it  

## Building

Clone the repository and build the container.

```
$ go get github.com/asobti/kube-monkey
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/asobti/kube-monkey
$ make container
```

## Configuring
kube-monkey is configured by a toml file placed at `/etc/kube-monkey/config.toml`.  
Configuration keys and descriptions can be found in [`config/param/param.go`](https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey/blob/master/config/param/param.go)

#### Example config file

```toml
[kubemonkey]
dry_run = true                           # Terminations are only logged
run_hour = 8                             # Run scheduling at 8am on weekdays
start_hour = 10                          # Don't schedule any pod deaths before 10am
end_hour = 16                            # Don't schedule any pod deaths after 4pm
blacklisted_namespaces = ["kube-system"] # Critical deployments live here
```

## Deploying

Run kube-monkey as a Deployment within the Kubernetes cluster, in a namespace that has permissions to kill Pods
in other namespaces (eg. `kube-system`).

See dir [`examples/`](https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey/tree/master/examples) for example Kubernetes yaml files.

## Compatibility with Kubernetes

kube-monkey is built using v1.5 of [kubernetes/client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go). Refer to the 
[Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go#compatibility-matrix) to see which 
versions of Kubernetes are compatible.

## To do

- Add tests
- Use a logging library like [glog](https://github.com/golang/glog)
